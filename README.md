# winter-break-homework

## Instructions:

Complete all 7 problems in the [Winter Break Homework Collection](https://www.codewars.com/collections/winter-break-homework). These problems are designed to be completed independently without the help of your peers (hence why it is called a Winter Break Assessment)! 

After you complete each problem:

1. Add a multi-line comment explaining how your solution works (line by line, in the order of execution)
2. Copy your solution and the accompanying comment into the code-wars-solutions.js file and commit.
3. Click the SUBMIT button on code wars.

When you are done with ALL problems:

* Make sure you are logged into your Code Wars account. 
* Go to the Kata Tab and make sure the tab shows your solutions to all 7 of the coding problems. 
* Copy the URL. The URL should be something like: [https://www.codewars.com/users/codingwithann/completed](https://www.codewars.com/users/codingwithann/completed)
* Edit this README and paste the URL below:
